# Losing a master device

in the unfortunate event of losing your master device, you need to create a new one.
This can be done preemptively by assigning a second mobile device as `backupMasterDevice`.
If there is none, then user can initiate this from a new mobile device, but a security challenge must be undertaken.
At the moment we only implement a security question of your choosing.

We have on our roadmap:

1. Face recognition
2. NationalId card verification

When they are implemented you will be able to enable all three or pick any permutation of the verification methods you wish.
